          COLĒGIA
          <br/>
          Effective as of October 8, 2020
        </p>
        We at Colegia LLC  (“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) created this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to provide you with information on how the information you provide to us is used and shared on our COLĒGIA platform and website. This Privacy Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of Company in connection with our COLĒGIA platform, website, and services (the “Services”), which are made available to you through the COLĒGIA website (the “Site”). We strive to educate parents and kids about how to appropriately safeguard their privacy when using our Services. We are committed to complying with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”). We utilize the consents of our K-12 schools to acquire consents from parents and legal guardians for the collection and processing of students’ personal information through our Services. We recommend that parents discuss with their kids restrictions regarding the online release of Personal Information (as defined below) to anyone they don’t know.
<br/>
By visiting our Site and/or using our Services, or by permitting your child to use our Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Service. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in our Terms of Service.<br/><br/>
Information We Collect<br/><br/>
<b>1. Personal Information.</b> <br/>We do not collect any personal information from you unless you voluntarily provide it to us or it is provided to us by your school, school district, or higher educational institution. When you sign up to become a user of the Site (a “User”), you will be asked to provide us with certain personal information, such as your first name, last name, and e-mail address. We may also receive, and you consent to our receipt of, additional personal information from your student’s school, school district, or higher education institution in order to provide the Services, such as academic and student records, attendance, grades, test results, student ID, school name, and related performance data. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to all of the information referenced in this paragraph as “Personal Information.”<br/>
<br/>
In particular, you consent to our receipt of Personal Information from your school, your school’s School Board, any higher education institution or other institution authorized by your school to share Personal Information with us.  Disclosure of this Personal Information is made at the request of your school’s Governing Board and not the School Board.  Receipt of these records is authorized under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), a federal law that regulates the privacy of student records, and we are subject to all of the same conditions regarding the use and protection of said records as all school officials, as further provided in 34 CFR §99.33. As a contractor for your school, we receive these disclosures on the same basis as school officials employed by your school and are under the direct control of your school in our use of these records. Consistent with FERPA, we confirm that we have a legitimate educational interest in receiving these records in that they are needed to perform the services contracted by your school. Our use of these records shall be strictly limited to fulfilling the performance of those services. Accordingly, your Personal Information shall not be re-disclosed by us for any reason without the express written consent of a parent or an eligible student (defined as a student who is either eighteen years of age or older or is enrolled in a postsecondary institution) in accordance with the provisions of 34 CFR §99.30(b), or unless your school has authorized the re-disclosure under, and in full accordance with, an applicable FERPA exception. Furthermore, if our agreement with your school is terminated and we are no longer performing services for your school, we will destroy the applicable student records contained in our systems.
<br/><br/>
<b>2. Usage Information. </b><br/>Like most platforms, we use automatic data collection technology when you visit the Site to record information that identifies your computer, to monitor and track your use of our Site, and to collect certain basic information about you and your surfing habits. This information includes information about your operating system, your IP addresses, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, keywords, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of a website you visit, and similar information concerning your use of the Site and the Services (the “Usage Information”).<br/>
We collect this Usage Information by using cookies and pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear gifs). Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of website users. You can reject cookies by following the directions provided in your Internet provider’s “help” file. If you reject cookies, you may still visit the Site, but may not be able to use some areas of the Site and/or the Services.<br/>
We also collect Usage Information regarding any information or communications a user enters or transmits into our platform. E-mails sent and received and other activities on the platform and on third-party platforms linked to our platform may be monitored by us for safety purposes to ensure that users are complying with our Acceptable Use Policies and other aspects of our Terms of Service.
We do not collect Personal Information in this way, but if you’ve provided us with Personal Information, we may associate that information with the information that is collected automatically. Automatic data collection may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.<br/><br/>
If you choose to purchase or subscribe to a feature or Service of Company that requires a payment (such as if you obtain products or services via one of our third party providers on the COLĒGIA platform), you may be required to provide us with your payment information, including, without limitation, bank account numbers, credit card or debit card numbers, account details, ACH information, and similar data (collectively, “Payment Information”).<br/><br/>
Google Analytics. We use the Google Analytics platform to collect and process your Usage Information and assess how users are using the Site. Google Analytics uses “cookies,” which are text files placed on your computer that are used to collect Internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. Information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site is transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, compile reports on website activity for website operators, and provide other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. By using the Site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above. You can delete cookies already set by Google Analytics, or prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site, by disabling cookies in your Internet browser. You can find more information about Google’s applicable privacy regulations by visiting <a href="privacy.html" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a>.
