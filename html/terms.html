<br/><br/>
<b>11. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER</b><br/>
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, COMPANY’S SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, OR GUARANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Nothing in this Agreement is intended to exclude or limit any condition, warranty, right or liability that may not be lawfully excluded or limited.
<br/><br/>
<b>12. NOTICE OF CHANGES</b><br/>

<br/><br/>
<b>14. MISCELLANEOUS</b><br/>
You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, there will not be third party beneficiaries to the Terms. You acknowledge and agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship is intended or created between you and Company by these Terms.<br/>
The Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (including any policies, guidelines or amendments that may be presented to your from time to time) constitute the entire agreement between you and Company and govern your use of the Services, superseding any prior agreements between you and Company for the use of the Services. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions, rules, regulations, and applicable law that may apply when you use or purchase certain other updates. The provisions limiting Company’s liability will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.
<br/><br/>
The Terms and the relationship between you and Company are governed by the laws of the State of Florida (excluding its choice of law rules). You and Company agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within Miami-Dade County, Florida. In any such action, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all legal expenses incurred in connection with the action, including but not limited to its costs, both taxable and non-taxable, and reasonable attorney’s fees.
Company may assign or transfer (whether by merger, reorganization, consolidation, Intellectual Property or otherwise) these Terms or any obligation incurred under these Terms. Company may assign these Terms without your consent to a subsidiary or affiliated company that currently exists or that may be created in the future. These Terms will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors.
<br/><br/>
If any provision of these Terms is illegal or unenforceable, that provision is severed from these Terms and the other provisions remain in force. If Company does not enforce any right or provision in these Terms, it does not create a waiver of these rights of provisions unless they are acknowledged or agreed by Company in writing.
<br/><br/>
You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
